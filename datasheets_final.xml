        QuestionAnswer values are either Yes (1) or No (0)
        QuestionAnswerExpected value should match QuestionAnswer or the Data Quality Engine should throw a flag.
            The creator of the Datasheet should use QuestionAnswerExpected to flag a potential bias or data quality
            issue by mismatching these flags.


        Questions from the [Datasheets for Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) paper, v7.

        Questions are broken down by section with summaries here -

        -Motivation

        _The questions in this section are primarily intended to encourage dataset creators
        to clearly articulate their reasons for creating the dataset and to promote transparency
        about funding interests._

        -Composition

        _Most of these questions are intended to provide dataset consumers with the
        information they need to make informed decisions about using the dataset for
        specific tasks. The answers to some of these questions reveal information
        about compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or
        comparable regulations in other jurisdictions._

        -Collection process

        The answers to questions here may provide information that allow others to
        reconstruct the dataset without access to it._

        -Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling

        The questions in this section are intended to provide dataset consumers with the information
        they need to determine whether the “raw” data has been processed in ways that are compatible
        with their chosen tasks. For example, text that has been converted into a “bag-of-words” is
        not suitable for tasks involving word order._

        -Uses

        These questions are intended to encourage dataset creators to reflect on the tasks
        for which the dataset should and should not be used. By explicitly highlighting these tasks,
        dataset creators can help dataset consumers to make informed decisions, thereby avoiding
        potential risks or harms.

        -Distribution

        Uses outside the company

        -Maintenance

        These questions are intended to encourage dataset creators to plan for dataset maintenance
        and communicate this plan with dataset consumers.
